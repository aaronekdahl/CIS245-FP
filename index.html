	    	<h2>Cost Effective Business Solutions</h2>
				<p>The Raspberry Pi has been an excellent platform for many small and large business since its creation in 2012. The Raspberry Pi Model A and the Raspberry Pi Model B have been used to create demonstration units for in-store displays and restaurant menus; forever changing the way in which people interact with and percieve a businesses products and/or menus systems. </p>
				<h2>Personal Computing Solutions</h2>
	      <p>The Raspberry Pi has not only been a boon for businesses and disply techdnology, it's also grown to have a huge following by tech hobbyists. With a little bit of programming knowlege and if you're lucky some hardware (electrical engineering) skills such as soldering and breadboarding, the sky really is the limit. For example Raspberry Pi's have been utilized to create home security systems, retro gaming consoles, home servers, and home network ad-blockers through the use of a Tor based operation system that can be installed on any Pi device.</p>

	    		<h2>A Short History of the Raspberry Pi.</h2>

	    		<p>As of a couple of years ago, there have been over 12 million Raspberry Pi devices sold. That's pretty amazing considering the specs, which on paper are not all that impressive. But, what was impressive was the price. The first generation Raspberry Pi was an amazing $35. This is what lead to a quick adoption and love from the hobbyists who would eventually create an amazing community of fellow users. All of which were excited to start creating new and amazing things in the privacy of their own homes. THere have also been a multitude of resources and news outlets generating content for the tech hobbyist who would like to get in to creating things with Raspberry Pi.</p>

	    		<h3>The Model B & Other Variants</h3>
	    		<p>Here is a quick rundown of all the models that have been released since 2012. Starting in 2012 there is the Raspberry Pi Model B which started it all, this device had only an ethernet connection and no wireless. This was initially a small caveat that limited the portability of any home designs incorporating a Pi, it had to physically be wired to a network. There were other models released a couple of years later in 2014. They were the Model A+ and B+. All of which did not have wireless and even lacked ethernet ports with the exception of the B+.</p>

	    		<h3>The Model B & Other Variants</h3>
	    		<p>Then, in 2015 the Raspberry Pi 2: Model Zero was released this device was literally less than half the size of the already minute models it had succeeded. Again, the only drawback here was that the device didn't have wireless capabilities out of the box. Two years after the release of the Pi Zero the Pi W/WH was released. This version was sporting built in wireless capabilities and was a very popular successor to the original Zero, as well as the previously released 2016 Model B with Wireless, which will be explained later in this writing. </p>

					<h3>The Model B & Other Variants</h3>
	    		<p>Finally, in 2016 the best of the best in the Raspberry Pi world was released. The first Model B for the Raspberry Pi 3. This device was finally shipped from the manufacturer with wireless capabilites on board. Not only was this the most capable device ever it was also the most popular model of Reaspberry Pi to date. </p>
